The Tea Story - README
Project Overview

The Tea Story is a website that I decided to design to share my appreciation for tea with other people. This website provides educational content about tea, fun facts, popular tea recipes as well as info on a selected tea of the month. The website I created was structered to offer fun information about tea, it's culture, history, flavour and related topics. It also includes immersive and interactive features such as a scroll to top function using Javascript.

User Audience Intent and Purpose

Target Audience:
=> Tea enthusiasts who are interested in learning more about different teas
=> People who are new to tea and want to explore and understand more about it
=> Users who require and are searching for recipes, fun facts or even the history of some types of tea
=> For work or school purposes

Purpose:
The primary goal I wanted to achieve with the 'The Tea Story' website is to educate, and entertain the viewers by providing them with a good amount of content about tea. This includes:
=> Sharing weekly fun facts about tea
=> Showing recipes for popular tea drinks from around the world
=> Showcasing featured teas of the month. 

The website aims to make tea culture more accessible and enjoyable, combining both informative content and a user-friendly interface.

Who is this website catering to?

The Tea Story caters to ->

Tea Enthusiasts: People who already appreciate tea and are looking for more knowledge, new types of tea to try, and engaging facts about different types of tea.
Beginners and Newcomers to Tea Culture: People who are exploring the world of tea and looking to embark on their journey to learn more about tea
Casual Users and Hobbyists: Those who enjoy tea occasionally and want to discover new tea recipes or read interesting facts.

What is the Website catering for?

The Tea Story offers the following features and content: 

Tea Time : A seperate webpage that provides information for popular tea flavours from around the world. Allows the user to learn something about different teas (learn a bit of general knowledge about the different famous teas). 

Weekly Fun Facts: A separate webpage that provides fun facts about different tea flavours. Fun pictures and links to videos teaching more about the tea flavour and it's details. An educational page that allows users to know just a bit more about different teas. 

Tea of the Month: A separate webpage that introduces and provides information regarding the 3 select tea flavours of the month. The webpage will give a quick rundown of the selected flavour, it's origin, when it was founded, how it is enjoyed in different parts of the world, it's health benefits and fun facts about the tea. This will give users a sense of excitement to look forward to tasting this randomly selected tea flavour that they have learnt more about. 

Famous Recipes: A separate webpage that provides a recipe on how to make different famous teas. These teas will be grouped into categories, and each tea will have it's own subpage, where information such as the recipe, video on how to make it as well as what snacks you can have with these teas will be provided. This will be a fun and engaging addition to the website to give users a chance to explore classic tea recipes from around the world. 

The website uses these features to cater to different user needs, whether they are looking for knowledge, entertainment, or inspiration to try new teas and recipes.
