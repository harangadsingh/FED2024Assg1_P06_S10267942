                <p class = "description"> Oolong is neither a black tea nor a green tea; it falls into its own category of tea. Yet an oolong may end up with more black tea characteristics or more green tea characteristics depending on the direction the tea master takes in the processing of the tea.</p>

                <h3>Fun Fact 1</h3>
                <div class = "tea image">
                    <img src = "Photos/oolong123.jpg" alt = "Image of Fun Fact related to Oolong Tea">
                </div>
                <p>Oolong originates from the same Camellia sinensis tea plant. Ultimately, it is the processing & fermentation that leaves go through which will decide what type they will become.</p>

            <div class = "fun-fact">
                <h3>Fun Fact 2</h3>
                <div class = "tea image">
                    <img src = "Photos/oolongtea456.jpg" alt = "Image of Fun Fact related to Oolong Tea">
                </div>
                <p>Once the leaves of oolong are plucked, and “bruised” so as to break them up which releases oil, the oxidation method can be anywhere from 10 to 70 percent, depending on the specific variety. This type of tea is the one that goes through such a broad range of fermentation.</p>

                <p> China & Taiwan is the countries this tea is most often cultivated in. Chinese varieties give us a darker & woody tasting cup; whereas the Taiwanese varieties produce a lighter, more floral tasting brew.</p>
