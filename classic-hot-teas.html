            <h2>Earl Grey Tea</h2>
            <h3>What you will need:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Tea : 1 teaspoon loose tea, or 1 tea bag</li>
                <li>Cold Water : 1 cup [8 fl. oz]</li>
                <li>Teapot with infuser</li>
                <li>Tea Kettle</li>
                <li>Electric Kettle [Optional]</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Instructions:</h3>
            <h4>Step 1: Boil cold water.</h4>
            <p>Use an electric tea kettle with a temperature setting if possible. Just under the boiling point is perfect at 206°F.</p>

            <h4>Step 2: Warm up the teapot</h4>
            <p>
                Pour freshly boiled water into a teapot and swish it around. Then discard the water.
                Warming up the teapot allows the tea to unfurl, relax, and deliver the maximum flavor. 
                It also helps to keep the tea warm without dropping the temperature.
            </p>

            <h4>Step 3: Put the tea into the teapot and add hot water</h4>
            <p>
                Twinning's top tip is to “never pour boiling water over a tea bag or loose tea.” 
                They say, “This is because the boiling water will burn the tea, it scalds it, and therefore, the tea doesn’t release all of its maximum flavors.”
            </p>

            <h4>Step 4: Cover the teapot and steep for 3-5 minutes</h4>
            <p>
                Black tea is best steeped between 3 and 5 minutes. I like to steep Earl Grey for 4 minutes. 
                If you like a stronger cup of Earl Grey, brew more tea instead of steeping longer. Longer brewing can make your tea bitter.
            </p>

            <h4>Step 5: Strain tea leaves and pour the tea into a cup</h4>
            <p>
                Remove the tea leaves or tea bag from the teapot. Pour the tea into a cup and enjoy!

            <h2>Assam Black Tea</h2>
            <h3>What you will need:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Tea : 1 teaspoon loose tea, or 1 tea bag</li>
                <li>Cold Water : 1 cup [8 fl. oz]</li>
                <li>Teapot with strainer</li>
                <li>Tea Kettle</li>
                <li>Electric Kettle [Optional]</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Instructions:</h3>
            <h4>Step 1: Boil cold water.</h4>
            <p>
                Since tea is made with just water and tea leaves, use good quality water. Use filtered water instead of tap water if possible.
                I recommend using an electric kettle with a temperature setting so you can be more accurate with the water temperature. Set it to 208°F.
                Boil some extra water to warm up the teapot.
            </p>

            <h4>Step 2: Warm up the teapot</h4>
            <p>
                Pour a little freshly boiled water into the teapot. Swirl it around and then throw the water out.
                I always include this step when I’m trying to brew tea properly. If you don’t warm up the teapot, there will be a big temperature drop while brewing the tea.
            </p>

            <h4>Step 3: Put Assam tea into the teapot and add hot water</h4>
            <p>
                To make tea stronger, always add more tea instead of brewing it for longer. A longer brew time will only make your tea bitter, not stronger.
            </p>

            <h4>Step 4: Cover the teapot and steep for 3-5 minutes</h4>
            <p>
                To make tea stronger, always add more tea instead of brewing it for longer. A longer brew time will only make your tea bitter, not stronger.
            </p>

            <h4>Step 5: Strain the tea leaves and pour hot tea into a cup</h4>
            <p>
                To sweeten your tea, add sugar, honey, or date syrup. Enjoy!

            <h3>Instructions:</h3>
            <h4>Step 1: Boil water in saucepan</h4>
            <p>
                Boil water in a saucepan, when the water starts bubbling time to add the tea leaves.
            </p>

            <h4>Step 2: Add Darjeeling tea leaves</h4>
            <p>
                Once the tea leaves are added, cover the pan and turn off the heat immediately.
            </p>

            <h4>Step 3: Let it sit for 5-7 minutes</h4>
            <p>
                The leaves that are floating on top will settle down to the bottom eventually.
            </p>

            <h4>Step 4: Heat the tea again.</h4>
            <p>
                Tt’s time to heat the tea again for a few seconds because the tea must have gone cold in the process.
                Do not boil, just heat them for 30 – 40 secs.
            </p>

            <h4>Step 5: Strain the tea into a cup</h4>
            <p>
                Time to strain the tea with a tea strainer in the cup, add the sugar and milk.
                Mix well, and enjoy your Darjeeling tea.
