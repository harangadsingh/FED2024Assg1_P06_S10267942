                <p class = "description">Assam is a home to thousands of tea gardens that produce thousands of exquisite loose leaf teas with hundreds of flavors. Until recently, Assam was usually marketed simply as Indian tea, but today, both tea garden and quality grade are important for tea drinkers around the world. If you drink tea, there is a chance you have tried Assam at least once in your life. It’s a common ingredient in many blends – from English Breakfast to Earl Grey.</p>

                <p>Assam tea is usually described as full bodied and strong with a malty flavor. Full bodied means that tea is rich and complex and is most often related to black tea. Assam tea is a common ingredient in tea blends, used to give a stronger base and depth. The flavor can range from brisk, smokey, earthy, musky and strong to a lighter cup with chocolate, cocoa, or even sweet and spicy notes. CTC Assam tea will usually be stronger, sharper, maltier and maybe astringent. This type of tea is usually found in tea bags, rather than in loose leaf form. However, it makes a wonderful base for chai teas, or for teas that need to be strong to hold the aroma of spices, milk and sugar.</p>

                <p>The serendipitous discovery of Assam tea owes much to the vision and entrepreneurial spirit of Maniram Dewan, a key figure in the annals of Assam’s history. Born in 1806, Maniram Dewan was a multifaceted personality—a nobleman, a visionary, and a pioneering entrepreneur. His foray into the world of tea was sparked by the accidental findings of Scottish adventurer Robert Bruce, who stumbled upon wild tea bushes while exploring the verdant landscapes of Assam in 1823.
                    Recognizing the potential of these wild tea plants, Bruce shared his discovery with Maniram Dewan, who saw beyond the leaves’ medicinal use by the Singpho tribe. Dewan envisioned a thriving tea industry that could not only transform the economic landscape of Assam but also contribute significantly to the global tea trade. This marked the beginning of Dewan’s journey into the world of tea cultivation and the subsequent birth of Assam tea.</p>
