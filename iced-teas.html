            <h2>Iced Lemon Tea</h2>
            <h3>What you will need:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Tea : 1 teaspoon loose black/green tea leaves</li>
                <li>Cold Water : 1.25 liters [5.25 cups]</li>
                <li>Saucepan</li>
                <li>Sugar : 1/3 to 1/2 cup</li>
                <li>Lemon : 3 tablespoons lemon squeeze</li>
                <li>Strainer</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Instructions:</h3>
            <h4>Step 1: Boil cold water.</h4>
            <p>Set the saucepan over a medium heat and bring the water come to a boil.</p>

            <h4>Step 2: Put the tea into the saucepan</h4>
            <p>
                Add the tea leaves to the boiling water. Let it steep for 5 minutes. Add your sugar and mix well.
            </p>

            <h4>Step 4: Cover the teapot and steep for 4-5 minutes</h4>
            <p>
                Black tea is best steeped between 3 and 5 minutes. I like to steep this for 4 minutes. 
                If you like a stronger cup of tea, brew more tea instead of steeping longer. Longer brewing can make your tea bitter.
            </p>

            <h4>Step 5: Add lemon squeeze into the tea</h4>
            <p>
                Add the lemon squeeze into the tea and mix well. Let the tea cool down to room temperature and stir the mixture well with a spoon
            </p>

            <h4>Step 6: Strain the tea into glass jar for storage</h4>
            <p>
                Strain the tea into a glass jar and store it in the refrigerator. Serve chilled with ice cubes and lemon slices. Enjoy!

            <h2>Iced Green Tea</h2>
            <h3>What you will need:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Tea : 2 teaspoons loose tea, or 2-3 tea bags</li>
                <li>Cold Water : 1 cup [8 fl. oz]</li>
                <li>Saucepan</li>
                <li>Ice : 2-3 cups</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Instructions:</h3>
            <h4>Step 1: Boil cold water.</h4>
            <p>
                Since tea is made with just water and tea leaves, use good quality water. Use filtered water instead of tap water if possible.
                I recommend using an electric kettle with a temperature setting so you can be more accurate with the water temperature. Set it to 190Â°F.
                Boil some extra water to warm up the teapot.
            </p>

            <h4>Step 3: Put tea leaves or bags into the teapot.</h4>
            <p>
                To make tea stronger, always add more tea instead of brewing it for longer. A longer brew time will only make your tea bitter, not stronger.
            </p>

            <h4>Step 4: Cover the teapot and steep for 3-5 minutes</h4>
            <p>
                To make tea stronger, always add more tea instead of brewing it for longer. A longer brew time will only make your tea bitter, not stronger.
            </p>

            <h4>Step 5: Strain the tea leaves and pour cooled down tea into a cup</h4>
            <p>
                Add ice cubes into the cup of tea. Enjoy your iced green tea!

        <div id = "icedBlueberry" class = "recipe-info">
            <h2>Iced Blueberry Tea</h2>
            <h3>What you will need:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Tea : 1 teaspoon loose tea, or 2-3 tea bags</li>
                <li>Cold water : 4 cups</li>
                <li>Blueberry : 1 cup</li>
                <li>Sugar : 1/3 cup</li>
                <li>Lemon : 2 teaspoons</li>
                <li>Potato masher</li>
                <li>Strainer</li>
                <li>Pitcher</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Instructions:</h3>
            <h4>Step 1: Add ingredients and bring it to a simmer</h4>
            <p>
                The process begins by making a blueberry simple syrup. 
                1 cup blueberries, 1/3 cup honey or sugar, 1/3 cup water, and 2 teaspoons lemon juice should be added to a small saucepan. 
                Over medium heat, bring the mixture to a simmer.
                Stirring consistently, use the spoon (you might also find a potato masher helpful) to crush the blueberries. 
                Once the sugar has fully dissolved and blueberries are all crushed, reduce the heat to low and simmer for 10 minutes.
            </p>

            <h4>Step 2: Strain the mixture </h4>
            <p>
                Strain the mixture into a pitcher and let it sit for a while.
            </p>

            <h4>Step 3: Bring 4 cups of water to a boil and add tea leaves/bags</h4>
            <p>
                Bring 4 cups of filtered water to a boil on the stovetop (or in a large glass measuring cup in the microwave). 
                Remove from the heat and add the black tea. Steep the tea in the water for five minutes. 
                Strain it with a fine mesh strainer.
            </p>

            <h4>Step 4: Mix everything together and enjoy!</h4>
            <p>
                Mix the blueberry simple syrup, brewed black tea, and remaining water by pouring them into a 68-72 ounce pitcher filled with 1 cup ice.
                Serve/pour over additional ice in glasses. 
                Garnish as desired with fresh mint leaves, sliced lemon, and adding a few fresh blueberries to each glass. Enjoy!
